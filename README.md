# TradeGame
This is a training project just to practice some coding skills.
The main objetive so far is to create a server that serve both the SPA to the client and also exposes the API required to 
perform some common operations.

Current roadmap:
* Finish configuration (Add Babel, React and Meteor).
* Add authentication and session management (sign in / sign up).
* Add data persistence (database to be decided).
* Add user chat.
* Add game features!!!
* Have some fun playing...
